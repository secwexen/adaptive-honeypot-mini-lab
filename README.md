# adaptive-honeypot-mini-lab
Adaptive Honeypot Mini-Lab: A small-scale honeypot system that dynamically reconfigures itself based on attacker behavior.  It emulates fake services such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP, analyzes attack patterns, and integrates with SIEM systems to tag logs.  Designed as a short-term demo project, deployable on Raspberry Pi or Docker.
